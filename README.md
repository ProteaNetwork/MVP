# Current Status of Repo
We are currently working towards an alpha release of the Protea Minimum Viable Dapp (MVD). The requirements for this release are still incomplete. 

Outstanding Functionalities
* Completion of Proof of Attendance mechanism
* Completion of Wallet Tx Interaction
* Completion of Token Structure
* Completion of modification to ProteaParty attendance confirm-function

# Next Major Milestone 

Our next major milestone will be the alpha release of our Minimum Viable Dapp (MVD), which will then be tested at various Ethereum community meetups around the world.

The focus here is to deploy a Dapp that alows for the following user flows:

* An organiser creates an event contract for her meetup and defines the amount of attendees
* Community members wishing to attend stake their attendance via a meetup token
	* During the meetup event the organizer presents a QR code that attendees can scan with their smartphone, triggering a call to the event contract to withdraw their token
* This will also trigger proof of attendance mechanisms
* Anyone who doesnâ€™t attend loses their stake, which is distributed to all who did attend the event
* Participants can thus end up with additional stake after the meetup

The Dapp will rely on the following 3 core components:
1. The events contract deployment and withdraw functions (back-end)
2. The user interface and experience, managed via uPort and potentially Status (front-end)
3. The ERC223 contract (the skin in the game)

# Documentation on Current Repo

The current repo presents the first iteration of the Protea MVD. We develop a method for meetup groups and communities to create decentralized events and stake their attendance via an RSVP function that deposits ERC223 tokens into an event contract and returns them to the attendant upon successful attendance. This includes:

* Token version of [Makoto's BlockParty](https://github.com/makoto/blockparty)
* A token faucet to get initial tokens
* Front end app using [Truffle's](truffleframework.com) [Drizzle Box](https://github.com/truffle-box/drizzle-box    ) 

## Getting Started

The individual MVP components are stored in on their own branches. The readme is to be updated depending on that features requirements.

### Prerequisites


`Node.Js`, `Truffle`, `Genache-cli`, `npm` or `yarn`, `geth`


### Installing

The project uses Dotenv for environment variables, please create the `.env` file and add:
```
INFURA_API_KEY=YOUR-KEY
MNEMONIC=candy maple cake sugar pudding cream honey rich smooth crumble sweet treat
NODE_ENV=development
```


```
npm install or yarn install
```

### ERC223 & Tokenized BlockParty
Firstly open either Ganache GUI or Ganache-cli at port 7545.

To run Ganache-cli

```yarn run testnet```

To deploy the contracts, use:

```truffle migrate```


### Front end

First start up Ganache at port 7545 running at 3 second block time,

```yarn run testnet``` 

then compile the truffle contracts

```truffle compile```

Next deploy the contracts

```truffle migrate --network development```

Then load up the app with

```yarn run start```
